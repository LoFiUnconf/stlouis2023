# Local-first and capitalism

* How to make it successful?
* How to get it out to users?

* Nick: I don’t want to be in the position of holding people’s data hostage (encrypted, but still sole owner). A business challenge.
* Lucas: Working on Quiet chat
* Albert: How to get people to care about this? How does local first work for kids?
* Holes: Quiet app. How do you make sure people’s desire aligns with the values.
* Brook: Quiet app. Curious about how people are thinking about this and business perspective.
* Ben: Web3Storage, very interested in it, but my mum isn’t. What’s the value proposition for normal people? How’s it getting paid for?
* Stephen: Capitalism and sustainability. Not the log4j problem of volunteers; an interesting intersection between altruism, local-first and open source. How to do it deliberately, not as a by product.
* Chris: App development platforms. How do we set up business models for users? How does this apply to kids and building a safe software world.
* Conrad: Zed.dev, The adoption problem?
* Dana: I work in VC for dev tools and infrastructure. Good at user-adoption, JAM stack etc.
* Adam: I like to own my data and be independent from others. How to introduce kids to computing?
* Parthiv: I’ve working in research places for the long term and on the startup side, for the quick shipping. How do you succeed in introducing the ideas you care about in the world?
* I don’t have a lot of history in tech, but I understand the values. I want something that works as well as the apps we have.
* Matt: I hear people talking about solutions, but not about problems enough. Been doing an open source project for 15 years, but have failed to make it sustainable, despite 100,000 companies using it – seems super risky. How do we protect these bits of infrastructure?
* Yonz: I don’t have control over my data, we’re given pre-built systems instead of products we can hack on. These are not possible in a silo, local-first should put user-control first. Passionate about that. I run a discord called LoFi Software to encourage collaboration and platform building. There’s a 10x better UX accessible with local-first design, no signups, no starting from scratch, we just need somebody to build it.


Three themes:
* What is the economic viability?
* What is the value proposition for a lot of users?  
* Local first in relation to kids and what that means?

What’s a business model that’s not based on only investors?
* IT has to be cheap to make an MVP to get users onboard.
* So if you fail a few times at that, so you can get people to bootstrap without venture send.
* Free version that doesn’t rely on the shared infrastructure, paid add-on for the company hosted stuff.
* You can use the app for free, but connectivity costs money. Kin d of freemium
* You can install your own service, but most people don’t want to do that, charge for that.
* Charge for convenience.
* Arguably part of the moat is that you own the users, you want to protect from people moving away.
* Users would have to value privacy and portabliity more than convenience which they probably don’t.
* If you make software development cheaper, you can pass that saving onto the user. The free plan can be more generous.
* In 2001 photo storage was really expensive, Facebook does that for free, because of cloud efficiency.
* Maybe we can do that again, now storage is even cheaper.
* Investment’s not a business model, it’s an influx of capital because you haven’t hit revenue targets.
* Local first is tied to encryption and data-portability, so you lose the network effect you get in a cloud-native universe.
* Large communities, some of those benefits get taken away.
* I’m not here as an investor, what is this? Everyone was talking about cloud native everything, and now it’s come around again.
* These are different sources of upstart money, but the only way to get to sustainable is per-seat/per-whatever costs.
* How do we fund the shared infrastructure that people need? The road to the hospital, e.g
* It’s impossible to make money in a 3rd-party marketplace immediately because you don’t have enough people.
* In the LAMP stack, PHP is essential. But PHP was built by enthusiasts.
* That was chance and we can be more deliberate. We care about open-source we need to think about what we need, and the ways we can fund it.
* See Evan’s talk on the economics of programming languages.
* I have an unfounded belief in mom and pop software companies. In the 80s people built software buy themselves, the game industry is seeing this already, people are going back to building stuff by themselves.
* Build a small company, don’t try and scale it infinitely. At odds with VC maybe, but I don’t want that.
* I don’t know of that model supports infrastructure.
* As a business owner maybe I could make an irrational choice and help some people to build it.
* Is this doable?
* It’s possible to find people to build things, but less possible for them to run things and maintain things.
* You can volunteer time, but not money.
* The problem with company size is that it’s hard to find the equilibrium – either you’re growing or you’re shrinking, impossible to get to size that pays bills without changing size.
* There are counter-examples: Craigslist, SQLite, etc.
* SQLIte is open-source project/product. Not sure it’s possible with services.
* Apache and PHP examples of services, but you have to bring your own infrastructure.

* Are we worried about competitiveness, or business model, or…?
* There are some aspects of local-first that put more burden on the user. Maybe fixable.
* For example: merge hell, if you can merge automatically but fork when you can’t. That puts the burden on the user, which makes the experience worse.
* The user-experience I want is: one button and it just works. Part of the issue is if big complicated things happen it’s confusing.
* But why are you doing complicated things? The best software is doing less and less, you’re asymptotically approaching that. That should happen less.
* I haven’t built this, so not sure.
* This connects to the tradeoff issues, when you’re writing on the plane, conflict resolution is only a problem because you’ve enabled the new experience. What am I actually solving with this?
* What can you leave out? If you can solve just the one problem, but the cost is this: if you want to edit on the plane and merge later, you have to use a resolution tool. Maybe that trade-off is what you want, maybe not.
* The specific user-benefits are really interesting: no passwords, offline mode, 
* Can I edit a document without sign in with Facebook?
* Irene Ao says “good design is like a refrigerator, when it works you don’t think about it, but when it doesn’t, it stinks”.
* Fridges are now getting more complicated, ice-makers screens, etc. are they detracting from what we want?
* What are you building? Visual app development for a variety of platforms. Not local-first yet, but how do you apply this to building other apps? How does it become a design principal?
* As I listen to comments about business model. What does access to data give you? It’s a trillion dollar idea; if you have all your own data and you can build software on that. Local-first unlocks consolidated client-side data, which can power frictionless experiences.
* Your data can tell you things like “you’re not feeling well because you drank too much last night”.
* local-first is having my devices work offline.
* local-first is about collaborating with CRDTs
* I posit it’s really about local access to private data. It’s the only way you can have local access to private data.
* That’s an attractive pitch, I can imagine the synergies on my device. For a lot of different users there’s one piece of the story that’s valuable to them. Offline or private or…, etc.
* It’s too easy to treat local-first as a mindset instead of solving the problems people care about.


* What are the downsides of current local first apps?
* It doesn’t work with OAuth, you can’t log in, no design patterns, immature ecosystems.
* The data-silo version of the 16 standards problem. Just adds another unique way of doing it, haven’t solved interoperability.
* Unless you want to buy everything from Apple, you need all your apps to talk to each other.
* You also need to trust all the software you install. Just because it’s local-first doesn’t mean you actually trust it.
* At least now I know all my data is on Facebook and so at least I know where all the terrible things are happening. 
* Set the threshold for users being able to query their data. Make sure all the data is in a central repository.
* Once you have that, then the read story gets really complicated. Exfiltration and ML training can take this knowledge and siphon it off.
* LoFi can be an umbrella, identity storage and app store. You can use private keys and store your data encrypted, and all LoFi apps can use it. Slowly build a permission system, allow apps to write or read from things.
* Step 1: store data so users can access it.
* Step 2: restrict 3rd-party access initially
* Another way to implement this would be that all apps can read anything, but no-one allowed network access.
* Something that we’ve learned along the way is people say they care about privacy and portability, but 2BN people use Facebook.
* What’s the actual reason people would switch compared to the convenience they have.
* How do you put vegetables in candy?
* The bet I have is magical relevance: with safe access to the data you can do that.
* Semantic relevance. Instead of blindly trying to match things, it can be more surgical.

* We’ve just got to find the it.
* What do we all agree on that’s the thing we need to solve?
* There’s an interesting thing where the user has control, when the software is usable by the end user.
* You have all your data, and now you can do interesting things.
* You have control, people like power and control.
* Facebook but local is a hard sell: all my friends are on the other one.
* Once everyone switches to this it will be cool: hard sell.
* Open source is cool, Right to repair is cool.
* If you let people do interesting things, people will do interesting things.
